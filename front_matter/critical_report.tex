    & 266–363 & vl & The directives “Oboe”, “T.” and “Vv.” in vl 2
                    indicate the beginning and end of segments where the oboe
                    should play instead of the violin, unison with the violin,
                    or pause, respectively. Based on these directives,
                    the oboe part of this edition has been assembled.
                    Nevertheless, the directives are retained in vl 2.
                    Similar directives for a tromba appear in vl 1, i.\,e.,
                    “Tromba”, “T.”, and “Vv.”. However, a separate tromba part
                    has been written in \B1. These two alternative tromba parts
                    are here shown as “tr” and “clno” parts, respectively.
                    In tr, bars 266, 277, 282–284, 305–309, 323–325, 337,
                    and 360–362 were emended to accommodate the
                    instrument’s range.
